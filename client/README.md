# Setting up the client (React Frontend)

- Fork and clone the entire repository.
- Make sure you have setup the backend successfully using Truffle and Ganache GUI. After migrations are complete (using `truffle compile` and `truffle migrate --reset `) make sure that you have copied the License.ABI found in smart_contract/build to client/Services/ABI. This step is crucial. 
- Go to the clients folder.
- Run `npm install ` for npm to obtain all dependencies locally.
- To run the code in the test environment write `npm run dev`.
- Vite will run the development server in localhost:3000. However please check the terminal for the correct URL.
- Your are free to change the contents and try out new UI changes.
